            <div class="smallText">Camp 75 is a week of 75-minute camps led by middle and high school students where Pre-K â€“ 4th graders play games, sing songs, watch skits, and have fun! Before the students put on these camps they go to Bootcamp, a weeklong retreat for them to have fun, learn how to put on these camps, and grow in their relationship with God. I have been involved with Camp 75 for over 8 years. As a 6th grader I signed up, had an amazing experience serving my community, and never looked back. In 8th grade I was asked to become a captain, which meant I would be leading a team of students and be in charge of my camp. I absolutely loved doing this and was also a captain my freshman, sophomore, and senior year (we did not have Camp 75 my junior year due to Covid-19). After my senior year I was asked to come back and run the camp as an intern. I happily accepted this offer since it would be a great way to end my time at the camp that had become such a large part of my life. Starting in November of my freshman year of college we began preparing for the upcoming summer. Some of my responsibilities included placing the students on teams, organizing transportation, hosting on stage, and running day to day activities. One of the toughest things to manage was an ongoing game of assassins that I organized for all the captains to play. This game not only served as a bonding opportunity, but it also helped promote the camp since the only way to be safe was to wear a Camp 75 shirt. That year we had over 400 students attend Bootcamp and over 3000 people involved in Camp 75. My intern experience was truly the perfect way to end that chapter of my life. I had so much fun, made many lifelong friends, and felt like I had given back to the camp that had given so much to me.</div>
